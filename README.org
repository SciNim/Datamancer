** Comparison to other dataframe libraries

Check out the following gist for a comparison of this library with
dplyr (R) and pandas (Python):

** Documentation

The documentation is found at:

https://scinim.github.io/Datamancer/

with a short introduction under:

https://scinim.github.io/Datamancer/datamancer.html

and a tutorial for data wrangling with Datamancer available at:

https://scinim.github.io/getting-started/basics/data_wrangling.html

** Installation & dependencies

Installation should be just a 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
nimble install datamancer
#+END_SRC
away.

** Features and formulas

The data frame provides the "5 verbs" of [[https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/][dplyr]] and more. Main implemented functions:
- =filter=
- =mutate=, =transmute=
- =select=, =rename=
- =arrange=
- =summarize=
- =group_by=
- =arrange=
- =inner_join=
- =set_diff=
- =count=
- =bind_rows=
- =gather=
- =unique=,
which are all based on the =FormulaNode= object. Basically they all
receive =varargs[FormulaNode]=, which is evaluated in context of the
given dataframe.

** Supported types

By default the =DataFrame= type supports these types as builtins:
- =float=
- =int=
- =string=
- =bool=
- =Value= (a variant object that can store either of the above)

As of version =v0.3.0= very experimental support to extend the
supported types has landed. See the [[changelog.org]] for an explanation or
the [[playground/non_generic_generics.nim]] example to get an idea.

Essentially any arbitrary type can be used in a DF by extending the
=Column= type using some macro magic.

** A few words on the =f{}= macro to create formulas

Use:
- no infix symbol and only code, which does not involve a column in
  the sense defined below in [[Column access]]:
  #+BEGIN_SRC nim
  f{1 + 2}
  f{"foo"}
  f{true}
  #+END_SRC
  a =FormulaNode= of kind =fkVariable=. Stores the values as a =Value=
  variant object.
- =<-= for assignment
  #+BEGIN_SRC nim
  f{"newName" <- "oldName"}
  #+END_SRC
  a =FormulaNode= of kind =fkAssign=.
  This does not involve a closure and is just a simple object storing
  a LHS as a string and the RHS as a =Value= (to also support constant
  columns via =f{"constantCol" <- 5}=).
  Typically used for =rename= or as an argument for =transmute= and
  =mutate= to just rename a column or to assign a constant column.
- =<<= for reduce operations
  #+BEGIN_SRC nim
  f{"meanHwy" << mean(`hwy`)}
  #+END_SRC
  a =FormulaNode= of kind =fkScalar=.
  Used only for =summarize= and means we reduce a full column to a
  single =Value=. This generates a closure, which computes the RHS and
  assigns it to a result variable of type =Value=. Type hints are
  required (for now) if only a single proc call is involved on the
  RHS to tell the macro as what to read the column "hwy" and what the
  result variable is.
- =~= for vector like proc
  #+BEGIN_SRC nim
  f{"xSquared" ~ `x` * `x`}
  #+END_SRC
  a =FormulaNode= of kind =fkVector=.
  Used in =mutate=, =transmute= to calculate a full column. This also
  generates a closure as the reduce operations =<<= does, except here
  we loop over the length of the DF and access each read tensor via =[idx]=.
- a formula without any infix symbols will be considered:
  - =fkVariable= if no column involved
  - =fkVector= else

*** Column access
To access columns in the context of formula, the biggest change
occured. In the old formula system, a literal string was attempted to
be resolved as a DF column dynamically. Since the new formulas are
compiled to closures, this would involve overhead and is thus avoided
for clearer separation between columns and real strings. This also
helps readers of a formula.

This means:
- =`columnName`=: accented quotes refer to a DF column. Be careful to
  only use this for simple letters (no non letter characters or spaces).
- =c"columnName"= : call string literals (by convention use a =c=
  before the string) are interpreted as a column in the same way as
  accented quotes, but allow for column names with spaces / non letter
  characters.
- =idx("columnName"), idx(`columnName`), idx(nimExpressionReturningString)=:
  refers to a specific element of the referred column
- =col("columnName"), col(`columnName`), col(nimExpressionReturningString)=:
  refers to a the full tensor of the referred column
- or directly via: =df[nimExpressionReturningString] /
  df[nimExpressionReturningString][idx]=: to access columns / indices using
  identifiers / symbols / general expressions that return a string
  quotes, call string literals or just string literals). This is
  equivalent to =idx= / =col=, so the latter are preferred.

The closures take a data frame as an argument, which is named
=df=. The =df["columnName"]= refers to that argument, although not
literally (it is gen'symmed and =df["columnName"]= refers to a
=Column=). From that column we get the underlying =Tensor=.

In the context of calling procedures, e.g.:
#+BEGIN_SRC nim
f{someProc(`columnName`)}
#+END_SRC
it may not be clear whether the procedure is supposed to take the
whole tensor as an argument or hand each element of the tensor in a
loop. Internally the macro tries to determine a suitable call for
either a scalar or tensor argument. If the called procedure is unique
this will likely succeed. In case of heavily overloaded symbols
(e.g. =max=) it also tries to determine a match from (if any)
additional arguments given to that procedure (and uses their types if
they are not column references).

In case at cannot be resolved, you will get an error at compile time
to specify =idx= (per index access) or =col= (full column access) of the column.

So for example:
#+BEGIN_SRC nim
f{"asFloat" ~ parseFloat(idx("colName"))}
#+END_SRC
where =parseFloat= acts on each element individually. If there is only
a single overload (as in case of =parseFloat=), the input and output
types are inferred automatically to be:
- read tensor =colName= as a =string=
- result type is =float=

*** Type information for columns

When accessing columns sometimes it may be necessary or desired to
specify the type with which a column should be read. To achieve this,
the =idx= and =col= helpers mentioned in the previous section can be
given an explicit type:
#+begin_src nim
idx("foo", int) # <- reads "foo" as a `Tensor[int]`
col("bar", float) # <- read "baz" as a `Tensor[float]`)
#+end_src

These can be mixed and matched to read differently typed columns in
the same formula:
#+begin_src nim
f{"foo" ~ idx("x", int) + idx("yStr", string).parseInt}
#+end_src
for an example.

*** Type hints

To avoid specifying the types of every input column (as mentioned above
using =idx= and =col=) and to force a specific return type, type hints
can be used.

Type hints are required if the formula macro cannot determine the type
required, either input or output. This is usually the case for
ambiguous operations (overloaded procedures, only a single column
without any operations, etc.). They are of
the form:
- =<type>: <actualFormula>=: simple type hint for the type of the
  underlying tensor of the columns involved in the formula.  
- =<type> -> <resDtype>: <actualFormula>=: full type for closure.
  =<type>= is the dtype used for input tensors, =<resDtype>= the resulting
  type.
For example:
#+begin_src nim
f{int -> int: `x` * `y`}
# ^--- type of the tensors involved on the RHS. Will be read as integers
#        ^--- type of the resulting tensor
#+end_src
In this case the type would be determined to be float by the macro, so
type hints are required in case we need them to be integers.

In addition to looking at symbols in the scope, there is a step
involving some simple heuristic rules, e.g. if =*=, =/= is involved, it's
assumed that the input tensors are floats and the output as well. If
=&= or =$= is involved, it's assumed to be strings. 
Finally if =and= and other logic keywords are used, the result is
assumed to be =bool= (not the input thought!). 

#+BEGIN_SRC nim
    const floatSet = toSet(@["+", "-", "*", "/", "mod"])
    const stringSet = toSet(@["&", "$"])
    const boolSet = toSet(@["and", "or", "xor", ">", "<", ">=", "<=", "==", "!=",
                            "true", "false", "in", "notin"])
#+END_SRC
